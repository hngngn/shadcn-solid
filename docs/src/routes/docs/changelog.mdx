## May 2024 - CLI and components update

### CLI Updates

#### `diff`

Track upstream component updates with `diff`.

Run the `diff` command to get a list of components that have updates available:

```bash
npx shadcn-solid diff
```

```bash
┌   shadcn-solid
│
◇  The following components have updates avaiable
│
●  alert - path\to\my-ap\components\ui\alert.tsx
│
●  card - path\to\my-ap\components\ui\card.tsx
│
└  Run diff <component> to see the changes
```

Then run `diff [component]` to see the changes:

```bash
npx shadcn-solid diff alert
```

```tsx
const alertVariants = cva(
- "relative w-full rounded-lg border",
+ "relative w-full pl-12 rounded-lg border"
)
```

#### `add`

Adding multiple components or using --all is significantly faster

  You can use this config to customize the installation directory for your `ui` components.

  A drop-in for your existing design system with no conflict. 🔥

  ```tsx /tw-/
  <AlertDialog class="tw-grid tw-gap-4 tw-border tw-bg-background tw-shadow-lg" />
  ```

  It works with `cn`, `cva` and CSS variables.

That's it. Happy Lunar New Year.
